# Search_Media_Tantum
Search all the forms in all files of a chosen directory which have middle endings
Once found, the script takes from Perseus the translation and the morphological parsing

The results are print in a txt file in the form:
    "file_id-verbal_form-translation-morpho_parsing-medium_tantum"
The last parameter (medium_tantum) is a bool (1 for medium tantum, 0 if not)

After each file a report with the statistics of the forms found is printed
together with the forms which were false positives or not in the Perseus Dictionary
